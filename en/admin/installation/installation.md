# Installation

## On a dedicated web server (recommended way)

To install wallabag itself, you must run the following commands:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/wallabag/wallabag.git
cd wallabag && make install
```

Now, read the following documentation to create your virtual host, then
access your wallabag.

> **[info] Information**
>
> To define parameters with environment variables, you have to set these
> variables with `SYMFONY__` prefix. For example,
> `SYMFONY__DATABASE_DRIVER`. You can have a look at [Symfony
> documentation](http://symfony.com/doc/current/cookbook/configuration/external_parameters.html).

---

> **[info] Information**
>
> If you want to use SQLite to store your data, please put `%kernel.root_dir%/../data/db/wallabag.sqlite` for the `database_path` parameter during installation.

## On shared hosting

Execute this command to download and extract the latest package:

```bash
wget https://wllbg.org/latest-v2-package && tar xvf latest-v2-package
```
You will find the [md5 hash of the latest package on our
website](https://wallabag.org/en#download).

Now, read the following documentation to create your virtual host, then
access your wallabag.

We provide a package with all dependencies inside. The default
configuration uses MySQL for the database. 
With this package, wallabag doesn't check for mandatory extensions used
in the application (theses checks are made during `composer install`
when you have a dedicated web server, see above).
If you want to change these settings, please edit `app/config/parameters.yml`.

To create a new user, please use the register form. Then, in order to have admin
permissions, please run this query in your favorite DMBS (by replacing `1` with
the id for this new user):

```sql
UPDATE wallabag_user SET roles = 'a:2:{i:0;s:9:"ROLE_USER";i:1;s:16:"ROLE_SUPER_ADMIN";}' where id = 1;
```
